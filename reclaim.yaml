    # Introduction
    Our story started right out of MIT and after years of collaborations between the founders of Reclaim. With the ever-changing landscape of how our healthcare insurance is working, we decided to come together, bringing our passion for financial planning and data science with our expertise in the healthcare space. We came up with Reclaim, to seamlessly help make all of our finances around our healthcare more understandable, reasonably priced, and optimally planned for. 
    
    Our mission at Reclaim is to **make health finances simple, personal, just right**.

#You can find out more about Swagger at [http://swagger.io](http://swagger.io) or on [irc.freenode.net, #swagger](http://swagger.io/irc/). For this sample, you can use the api key `special-key` to test the authorization filters.

#This API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and is based on [Petstore sample](http://petstore.swagger.io/) provided by [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) team. It was **extended** to illustrate features of [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo) tool and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) documentation. In addition to standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

### OpenAPI Specification
#    This API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and is based on
#    [Petstore sample](http://petstore.swagger.io/) provided by [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) team.
#    It was **extended** to illustrate features of [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo)
#    tool and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) documentation. In addition to standard
#    OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).
#    # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
#    This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with  [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).
#    And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser.
#    All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.
#    # Authentication
#    Petstore offers two forms of authentication:
#      - API Key
#      - OAuth2
#
#    OAuth2 - an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple
#    and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.

    ## Security
    All calls to Reclaim’s APIs are encrypted over HTTPS. Our APIs support connections using TLS version 1.2 or higher. All modern languages and frameworks support TLS 1.2 (although specific older ones do not).
    
#    While these examples illustrate the typical process of obtaining an access token and then properly utilizing that token in an Authorization header for subsequent API requests, be aware that it is extremely inefficient to request a new token if you already obtained one that is still valid (note the number of seconds specified in the expires_in parameter in the cURL example’s response). For this reason we recommend using a PokitDok client library, giving you the ability to instantiate and use a long-lived PokitDok client connection that provides automatic handling of token retrieval, expiration, and rotation.

      summary: "Authorization via OAuth2"
      description: |   
       Access to our APIs is controlled via OAuth2 using the client credentials grant. This is a secure authorization workflow that allows you to obtain a **short-lived (1 hour)** access token that must be transmitted with your API request.
    
       The auth flow follows the following steps: 
         - A client encodes its `client key` and `secret key` into a specially encoded set of credentials. 
         - A client makes a request to the POST oauth2 / token endpoint to exchange these credentials for a bearer token.
         - When accessing the REST API, the client uses the bearer token to authenticate.

       In the cURL tab to the right you can see an example of obtaining an access token via the command line, then making a call to the Activities API with that token. Likewise, the Python tab contains an example of authorization from scratch using the popular requests library.
